	 <br> "You Belong With Me"<br>

<br>You're on the phone with your girlfriend<br>
She's upset, she's going off about something that you said<br>
'Cause she doesn't get your humor like I do.<br>

<br>I'm in the room, it's a typical Tuesday night.<br>
I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like.<br>
And she'll never know your story like I do.

<br>But she wears short skirts<br>
I wear t-shirts<br>
She's cheer captain<br>
And I'm on the bleachers<br>
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find<br>
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time.<br>

<br>If you could see<br>
That I'm the one<br>
Who understands you.<br>
Been here all along.<br>
So, why can't you see<br>
You belong with me,<br>
You belong with me.<br>

<br>Walk in the streets with you in your worn out jeans<br>
I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be.<br>
Laughing on a park bench thinking to myself,<br>
"Hey, isn't this easy?"<br>

<br>And you've got a smile<br>
That could light up this whole town.<br>
I haven't seen it in a while<br>
Since she brought you down.<br>

<br>You say you're fine I know you better than that.<br>
Hey, what you doing with a girl like that?<br>

<br>She wears high heels,<br>
I wear sneakers.<br>
She's cheer captain,<br>
And I'm on the bleachers.<br>
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find<br>
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time.<br>

<br>If you could see<br>
That I'm the one<br>
Who understands you,<br>
Been here all along.<br>
So, why can't you see<br>
You belong with me.<br>

<br>Standing by and waiting at your backdoor.<br>
All this time how could you not know, baby?<br>
You belong with me,<br>
You belong with me.<br>

<br>[Instrumental]<br>

<br>Oh, I remember you driving to my house<br>
In the middle of the night.<br>
I'm the one who makes you laugh<br>
When you know you're 'bout to cry.<br>
I know your favorite songs,<br>
And you tell me about your dreams.<br>
Think I know where you belong,<br>
Think I know it's with me.<br>

<br>Can't you see<br>
That I'm the one<br>
Who understands you?<br>
Been here all along.<br>
So, why can't you see<br>
You belong with me.<br>

<br>Standing by and waiting at your backdoor.<br>
All this time how could you not know, baby?<br>
You belong with me,<br>
You belong with me.<br>

<br>You belong with me.<br>

<br>Have you ever thought just maybe<br>
You belong with me?<br>
You belong with me.<br>
